# RPG With React Js

This project was mastered by Professor Bonieky Lacerda as a 5-day challenge using ReactJs

This is the fourth challenge where he teaches you how to create a character that moves around the map.

At some points I added Callback so I don't need to calculate everything again.

Also added the character name to make it more realistic
